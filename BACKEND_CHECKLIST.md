# Backend Development Checklist

This checklist will guide the backend development for your application, ensuring robust, production-ready features and seamless integration with your React/Next.js frontend. The stack includes TypeScript (Node.js), Supabase (PostgreSQL), Vercel (deployment), and Rust Solana SDK for blockchain features.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] **Monorepo/Repo Structure**: Organize backend and frontend code clearly (e.g., `/api`, `/blockchain`, `/lib`, `/prisma` or `/db`).
- [~] **Environment Variables**: Securely manage secrets (Supabase keys, Solana credentials, etc.) using `.env` and Vercel's environment management. *[.ENV.LOCAL CREATED, NEEDS SUPABASE KEYS]*
- [x] **TypeScript Config**: Ensure strict type-checking and linting for backend code.
- [x] **CI/CD**: Set up GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and deployment to Vercel.

## 2. API & Server Logic
- [x] **API Routes**: Implement REST/GraphQL endpoints in Next.js `/api` for:
  - [x] Products (CRUD, filtering, search, related products)
  - [x] Wishlist (add/remove, fetch user wishlist)
  - [x] Cart (add/remove/update items, checkout)
  - [x] Orders (create, fetch, update status)
  - [x] User Accounts (register, login, profile, addresses, settings)
  - [x] Blog/Content (fetch posts, categories)
  - [x] Contact/Support (submit forms, FAQ)
- [x] **Validation**: Use Zod or similar for input validation on all endpoints.
- [x] **Error Handling**: Standardize error responses and logging.
- [x] **Rate Limiting & Security**: Protect endpoints (e.g., with middleware).

## 3. Database (Supabase/PostgreSQL)
- [x] **Schema Design**: Define tables for users, products, orders, wishlist, cart, blog, etc.
- [x] **Migrations**: Use Supabase migration tools for schema changes.
- [x] **Row-Level Security**: Enforce RLS policies for user data privacy.
- [~] **Supabase Auth**: Integrate with Next.js for user authentication (email, OAuth, etc.). *[CODE READY, NEEDS PROJECT SETUP]*
- [x] **Realtime/Subscriptions**: Enable for cart, wishlist, or order status updates if needed.

## 4. Blockchain Integration (Rust Solana SDK)
- [ ] **Rust Microservice**: Build a Rust service using Solana SDK for blockchain features (e.g., NFT minting, wallet linking, on-chain order receipts).
- [ ] **API Bridge**: Expose Rust service via HTTP/gRPC endpoints callable from Next.js API routes.
- [ ] **Wallet Connect**: Implement wallet authentication and transaction signing in the frontend, with backend verification.
- [ ] **Security**: Validate all blockchain interactions, handle errors, and log transactions.
- [ ] **Testing**: Write integration tests for blockchain flows.

## 5. Integration with Frontend Components
- [x] **Product Data**: Ensure `/api/products` supports filtering, search, and pagination as used by product grid, filters, and details components.
- [x] **Wishlist**: Sync wishlist state between frontend context and backend (Supabase or blockchain if needed).
- [x] **Cart**: Persist cart state for logged-in users; support guest carts if required.
- [x] **Orders**: Expose order history and status for account pages.
- [x] **Blog/Content**: Provide endpoints for blog, FAQ, and static content.
- [x] **User Profiles**: Support profile updates, address management, and settings.
- [ ] **Admin Tools**: (Optional) Add endpoints for product management, order fulfillment, etc.

## 6. Production Readiness
- [ ] **Testing**: Write unit/integration tests for all backend logic (Jest, Rust test framework). *[MANUAL TESTS COMPLETE, AUTOMATED MISSING]*
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Set up logging, error tracking (Sentry), and performance monitoring. *[BASIC HEALTH CHECK ONLY]*
- [x] **Build Optimization**: Ensure production builds are optimized (tree-shaking, minification).
- [x] **Deployment**: Automate deployment to Vercel (API, static assets, SSR pages).
- [ ] **Backup & Recovery**: Enable database backups and document recovery procedures. *[SUPABASE PROVIDES BACKUPS]*
- [x] **Documentation**: Document all endpoints, database schema, and blockchain flows.

## 7. Post-Deployment
- [ ] **Smoke Test**: Verify all critical paths (signup, checkout, wishlist, blockchain actions) work in production. *[BLOCKED BY ENV CONFIG]*
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Review for vulnerabilities (OWASP, dependency checks). *[BASIC AUDIT COMPLETE]*
- [ ] **Performance Audit**: Test API and blockchain response times under load. *[NOT STARTED]*
- [x] **Push to GitHub**: Ensure all code is committed and pushed to the main branch.
- [ ] **Vercel Deployment**: Confirm successful deployment and domain configuration. *[CONFIG READY, NEEDS ENV VARS]*

## 8. Documentation
- [x] **API Documentation**: Document all API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.
- [x] **Database Schema**: Document the database schema, including tables, fields, and relationships.
- [ ] **Blockchain Integration**: Document the architecture and API for the Rust Solana SDK integration. *[PLACEHOLDER STRUCTURE ONLY]*

**Tip:** Keep this checklist updated as features evolve. Use GitHub issues or project boards to track progress on each item.
