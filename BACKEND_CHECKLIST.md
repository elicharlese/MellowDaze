# Backend Development Checklist

This checklist will guide the backend development for your application, ensuring robust, production-ready features and seamless integration with your React/Next.js frontend. The stack includes TypeScript (Node.js), Supabase (PostgreSQL), Vercel (deployment), and Rust Solana SDK for blockchain features.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] **Monorepo/Repo Structure**: Organize backend and frontend code clearly (e.g., `/api`, `/blockchain`, `/lib`, `/prisma` or `/db`).
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Securely manage secrets (Supabase keys, Solana credentials, etc.) using `.env` and Vercel's environment management.
- [ ] **TypeScript Config**: Ensure strict type-checking and linting for backend code.
- [ ] **CI/CD**: Set up GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and deployment to Vercel.

## 2. API & Server Logic
- [ ] **API Routes**: Implement REST/GraphQL endpoints in Next.js `/api` for:
  - [ ] Products (CRUD, filtering, search, related products)
  - [ ] Wishlist (add/remove, fetch user wishlist)
  - [ ] Cart (add/remove/update items, checkout)
  - [ ] Orders (create, fetch, update status)
  - [ ] User Accounts (register, login, profile, addresses, settings)
  - [ ] Blog/Content (fetch posts, categories)
  - [ ] Contact/Support (submit forms, FAQ)
- [ ] **Validation**: Use Zod or similar for input validation on all endpoints.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Standardize error responses and logging.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting & Security**: Protect endpoints (e.g., with middleware).

## 3. Database (Supabase/PostgreSQL)
- [ ] **Schema Design**: Define tables for users, products, orders, wishlist, cart, blog, etc.
- [ ] **Migrations**: Use Supabase migration tools for schema changes.
- [ ] **Row-Level Security**: Enforce RLS policies for user data privacy.
- [ ] **Supabase Auth**: Integrate with Next.js for user authentication (email, OAuth, etc.).
- [ ] **Realtime/Subscriptions**: Enable for cart, wishlist, or order status updates if needed.

## 4. Blockchain Integration (Rust Solana SDK)
- [ ] **Rust Microservice**: Build a Rust service using Solana SDK for blockchain features (e.g., NFT minting, wallet linking, on-chain order receipts).
- [ ] **API Bridge**: Expose Rust service via HTTP/gRPC endpoints callable from Next.js API routes.
- [ ] **Wallet Connect**: Implement wallet authentication and transaction signing in the frontend, with backend verification.
- [ ] **Security**: Validate all blockchain interactions, handle errors, and log transactions.
- [ ] **Testing**: Write integration tests for blockchain flows.

## 5. Integration with Frontend Components
- [ ] **Product Data**: Ensure `/api/products` supports filtering, search, and pagination as used by product grid, filters, and details components.
- [ ] **Wishlist**: Sync wishlist state between frontend context and backend (Supabase or blockchain if needed).
- [ ] **Cart**: Persist cart state for logged-in users; support guest carts if required.
- [ ] **Orders**: Expose order history and status for account pages.
- [ ] **Blog/Content**: Provide endpoints for blog, FAQ, and static content.
- [ ] **User Profiles**: Support profile updates, address management, and settings.
- [ ] **Admin Tools**: (Optional) Add endpoints for product management, order fulfillment, etc.

## 6. Production Readiness
- [ ] **Testing**: Write unit/integration tests for all backend logic (Jest, Rust test framework).
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Set up logging, error tracking (Sentry), and performance monitoring.
- [ ] **Build Optimization**: Ensure production builds are optimized (tree-shaking, minification).
- [ ] **Deployment**: Automate deployment to Vercel (API, static assets, SSR pages).
- [ ] **Backup & Recovery**: Enable database backups and document recovery procedures.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Document all endpoints, database schema, and blockchain flows.

## 7. Post-Deployment
- [ ] **Smoke Test**: Verify all critical paths (signup, checkout, wishlist, blockchain actions) work in production.
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Review for vulnerabilities (OWASP, dependency checks).
- [ ] **Performance Audit**: Test API and blockchain response times under load.
- [ ] **Push to GitHub**: Ensure all code is committed and pushed to the main branch.
- [ ] **Vercel Deployment**: Confirm successful deployment and domain configuration.

**Tip:** Keep this checklist updated as features evolve. Use GitHub issues or project boards to track progress on each item.
